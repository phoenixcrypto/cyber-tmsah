Fundamental Principles\n- **Newton's Laws of Motion**: The foundation of classical mechanics\n- **Conservation of Energy**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed\n- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Matter exhibits both wave and particle properties\n\n### 2. Applications in Technology\n- **Semiconductor Physics**: Essential for electronics and computing\n- **Optics**: Used in lasers, fiber optics, and imaging systems\n- **Thermodynamics**: Applied in engines, refrigeration, and power generation\n\n## Mathematical Foundations\n\n### Basic Equations\nThe fundamental equation of motion:\n```\nF = ma\n```\n\nWhere:\n- F = Force (N)\n- m = Mass (kg)\n- a = Acceleration (m/s²)\n\n### Energy Conservation\n```\nE_total = E_kinetic + E_potential\n```\n\n## Real-World Examples\n\n### 1. Smartphone Technology\nModern smartphones rely heavily on applied physics:\n- **Touchscreen**: Capacitive sensing based on electric fields\n- **Camera**: Lens optics and image sensor physics\n- **Battery**: Electrochemical energy storage\n\n### 2.

Keep laboratory areas clean and organized\n\n### Common Equipment\n- **Oscilloscope**: For measuring electrical signals\n- **Multimeter**: For measuring voltage, current, and resistance\n- **Power Supply**: For providing controlled electrical power\n- **Function Generator**: For creating various waveforms\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n### Problem 1\nA car with a mass of 1500 kg accelerates from rest to 20 m/s in 10 seconds. Calculate the force required.\n\n**Solution:**\nUsing F = ma:\n- a = (20 m/s - 0 m/s) / 10 s = 2 m/s²\n- F = 1500 kg × 2 m/s² = 3000 N\n\n### Problem 2\nA ball is dropped from a height of 20 meters. Calculate its velocity just before hitting the ground.\n\n**Solution:**\nUsing energy conservation:\n- Potential energy = Kinetic energy\n- mgh = ½mv²\n- v = √(2gh) = √(2 × 9.8 × 20) = 19.8 m/s\n\n## Summary\nApplied physics provides the foundation for understanding and developing modern technology. By combining theoretical knowledge with practical applications, we can solve complex problems and create innovative solutions.\n\n## Next Steps\n- Review the practice problems\n- Complete the assigned exercises\n- Prepare for the laboratory session\n- Read the next chapter on Mechanics and Motion",
